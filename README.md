devkit-application-template
===========================

Initial file structure for Gameclosure Devkit applications.

Includes an empty folder structure that matches the devkit defaults
and a minimal Application.js file with a "Hello, world!" text view.


You can specify a different initial template for new devkit applications
by adding the `--git-template` paramater to `devkit init` and passing in
a path to a git repository.
